    "I would ask if there is a statistically significant difference between the number of page views, purchases and conversions for each item, as more popular items are more likely to contribute to effective ad campaigns.  I would test this by comparing each item to the others with a t-test.  If none of the items have a significant advantage, I would choose the one with the highest profit margin.\n",

    "I would ask if any of the steps take more time to complete than average or have a lower rate of completion than the others, using a t-test to determine if the difference was significant.  I would also test how much marketing spending affects the number of sign up attempts on a weekly basis to determine if more or less spending is necessary.\n",

    "I would ask which hotels have the highest average number of bookings when compared to the number of times its page was visited, using a t-test to make sure the difference was significant.  I would include filters for price and availability, which would be more conducive to users finding a hotel that suits their needs.\n",
